The Paragraphs module in Drupal provides editors with a component driven architecture for building pages. Morpht has been developing Paragraph approaches to site building since 2015. This case study captures some of the content from a Drupal 7 "Paragraphs Demo" site which was built to showcase what could be done with Paragraphs.
